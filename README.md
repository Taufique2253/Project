The problem at hand is the need for an effective and reliable predictive model that can identify individuals at risk
of developing CKD. The model should leverage advanced data analysis techniques, machine learning algorithms,
and clinical parameters to generate accurate predictions. It should consider various factors such as patient demographics, medical history, laboratory tests (e.g., blood pressure, serum creatinine levels), and lifestyle indicators
to provide personalized risk assessments.
